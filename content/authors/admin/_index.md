I am a Professor of Geographic Information Science at the University of Liverpool, Deputy Director of the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) and Director of the ESRC Data Analytics & Society CDT. In a general sense my research is concerned with how the complexities of individual behaviours, attitudes and contexts manifest spatially, and can be represented and understood though a framework of geographic data science.
