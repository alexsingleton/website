abstract: This paper presents the methodology that has been used to create the 2011 Area Classification for Output Areas (2011 OAC). This extends a lineage of widely used public domain census-only geodemographic classifications in the UK. It provides an update to the successful 2001 OAC methodology, and summarizes the social and physical structure of neighborhoods using data from the 2011 UK Census. The results of a user engagement exercise that underpinned the creation of an updated methodology for the 2011 OAC are also presented. The 2011 OAC comprises 8 Supergroups, 26 Groups, and 76 Subgroups. An example of the results of the classification in Southampton is presented.
