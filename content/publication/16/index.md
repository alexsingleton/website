abstract: This special issue of Transactions in GIS presents ten research articles selected from the18th GIS Research UK (GISRUK) conference that took place at University CollegeLondon (UK) in April 2010, on the theme of ‘Tackling Global Challenges’. Thesecontributions provide a vivid account of the novel and interdisciplinary approaches beingcurrently developed to tackle a variety of global geospatial challenges. Our selectionillustrates ways in which complex and dynamic problems can be tackled through bridg-ing the gaps between long-established technical and epistemological silos within thebroad community that we here describe as ‘Quantitative Human Geography, UrbanModelling and Geographic Information Science’ (hence the title of this editorial).
