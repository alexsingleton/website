abstract: Geography is not a compulsory subject of study beyond the age of 14 in English schools and this hashad an impact on both absolute and relative participation rates over recent years. Geodemographicanalysis reveals that pupils domiciled within more affluent and less ethnically diverse areas recordthe highest rates of participation and attainment in GCSE Geography, and that the stratified patternsof participation have increased between 2005 and 2009. Within this period, those schools that havestopped supplying successful GCSE Geography entries by 2009 were found to have overall lowaggregate attainment and to draw pupils from more deprived areas. The profile of schools visited bythe Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) (RGS-IBG) AmbassadorScheme was also considered to assess the extent that the schools visited are representative of pupilswho are most at risk of non-participation.
