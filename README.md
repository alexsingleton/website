# About

The source code that is used to generate my personal website www.alex-singleton.com - in this current version I am using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/) template. Previously I have been using GitHub pages; but here I have swapped to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) which integrates with the repo and uses the "[public](https://github.com/alexsingleton/personal_website/tree/master/public)" folder.




[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d89c1371-8ada-4343-9d7a-e59ad3728eba/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/alexsingleton/deploys)
