However, the research on venture capital mainly focuses on the fields of finance, management, and economics, and fewer researchers study venture capital from the perspective of geography and space. This research explored the evolution characteristics and influence mechanism of Chinese venture capital spatial agglomeration. The innovation of this paper lies in including the spatial effect and conducting a spatial econometric analysis of the spatial agglomeration of venture capital in China after the exploratory analysis of the factors affecting the spatial agglomeration of venture capital. Firstly, based on the data of study area, this paper found that the spatial distribution of venture capital in China had an obvious agglomeration characteristic by using multiple measurement methods. Secondly, by constructing the spatial econometric model based on three different spatial weight matrices, we found that the science and technology environment, financial environment, social environment, and entrepreneurial environment levels were the main factors to affect the agglomeration of venture capital. Thirdly, due to the degree of spatial agglomeration of venture capital being divided into three stages in terms of time dimension, after the regression analysis of different periods, we found that the factors which affected spatial agglomeration of venture capital changed significantly with the passage of time. In addition, from the regression results of eastern, central, and western region samples, we can see that the degree of spillover effect was the lowest in the central region, the highest in the western region, and the middle in the eastern region. At last, this paper provided useful policy enlightenment for enterprise innovation, industrial upgrading, and regional economic management.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Evolution Characteristics and Influence Mechanism of Chinese Venture Capital Spatial Agglomeration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregory Palmer","Mark Green","Emma Boyland","Yales Stefano Rios Vasconcelos","Rahul Savani","Alex Singleton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"ddc14cab2a73356b84d22e3246fe7010","permalink":"/publication/55/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/55/","section":"publication","summary":"While outdoor advertisements are common features within towns and cities, they may reinforce social inequalities in health. Vulnerable populations in deprived areas may have greater exposure to fast food, gambling and alcohol advertisements, which may encourage their consumption. Understanding who is exposed and evaluating potential policy restrictions requires a substantial manual data collection effort. To address this problem we develop a deep learning workflow to automatically extract and classify unhealthy advertisements from street-level images. We introduce the Liverpool 360‚àò Street View (LIV360SV) dataset for evaluating our workflow. The dataset contains 25,349, 360 degree, street-level images collected via cycling with a GoPro Fusion camera, recorded Jan 14th‚Äì18th 2020. 10,106 advertisements were identified and classified as food (1335), alcohol (217), gambling (149) and other (8405). We find evidence of social inequalities with a larger proportion of food advertisements located within deprived areas and those frequented by students. Our project presents a novel implementation for the incidental classification of street view images for identifying unhealthy advertisements, providing a means through which to identify areas that can benefit from tougher advertisement restriction policies for tackling social inequalities.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Deep Learning Approach to Identify Unhealthy Advertisements in Street View Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessia Calafiore","Gregory Palmer","Sam Comber","Daniel Arribas-Bel","Alex Singleton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"5763eb3a43d5edf73bdd701646835b93","permalink":"/publication/60/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/60/","section":"publication","summary":"This study develops a Geographic Data Science framework that transforms the Foursquare check-in locations and user origin-destination flows data into knowledge about the emerging forms and characteristics of cities' neighbourhoods. We employ a longitudinal mobility dataset describing human interactions with Foursquare venues in ten global cities Chicago, Istanbul, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo. This social media data provides spatio-temporally referenced digital traces left by human use of urban environments, giving us access to the intangible aspects of urban life, such as people behaviours and preferences. Our framework capitalizes on these new data sources, bringing about a novel Geographic Data Science and human-centered methodological approach. Combining network science ‚Äì a study area with great promise for the analysis of cities and their structure ‚Äì with geospatial analysis methods, we model cities as a series of global urban networks. Through a spatially weighted community detection algorithm, we uncover functional neighbourhoods for the ten global cities. Each neighbourhood is linked to hyper-local characterisations of their built environment for the Foursquare venues that compose them, and complemented with a range of measures describing their diversity, morphology and mobility. This information is used in a clustering exercise that uncovers a set of four functional neighbourhood types. Our results enable the profiling and comparison of functional neighbourhoods, based on human dynamics and their contexts, across the sample of global cities. The framework is portable to other geographic contexts where interaction data are available to bind different localities into functional agglomerations, and provide insight into their contextual and human dynamics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Geographic Data Science Framework for the Functional and Contextual Analysis of Human Dynamics within Global Cities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The study uses a tree ensemble predictive algorithm, applying XGBoost using one year of historical training data to predict future purchase patterns. The study compares static and dynamic retraining approaches. Feature importance rank comparison and accumulated local effects plots are used to ascertain insights of the influence of different features. Clear purchasing seasonality is observed for both outcomes, reflecting the climatic drivers of the associated minor ailments. Although dynamic models perform best, where previous year behaviour differs greatly, predictions had higher error rates. Important features are consistent across models (e.g. previous sales, temperature, seasonality). Feature importance ranking had the greatest difference where seasons changed. Accumulated local effects plots highlight specific ranges of predictors influencing self-medication purchasing.

In this paper, we provide a computational method that summarises the ‚Äúvisual features‚Äù of shopping districts by analysing a national database of geocoded store frontage images. While the traditional focus of social scientific research explores how drivers such as proximity to shopping environments factor into location choice decisions, the visual characteristics that describe the enclosing urban area are often neglected. This is despite the assumption consumers translate visual appearance of a retail area into a judgement of its functional utility which mediates consumer behaviour, patronage intention and the image a retail location projects to passers-by. Such judgements allow consumers to draw fine distinctions when evaluating between competing destinations. Our approach introduces a deep learning model known as Convolutional Autoencoders to extract visual features from storefront images of leisure and retail amenities. These features are partitioned into five clusters before several measures describing the environment around the leisure and retail properties are introduced to differentiate between the clusters and assess which variables are distinctive for particular groupings. Our empirical strategy unpacks different groupings from the clusters, which implies the existence of relationships between visual features of shopping areas and functional characteristics of the surrounding urban environment. Ultimately, using the example of retail landscapes, the core contribution of this paper demonstrates the utility of unsupervised deep learning methods to research questions in urban planning.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Using Convolutional Autoencoders to Extract Visual Features of Leisure and Retail Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Alexandros Alexiou","Rahul Savani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"45b61f1b8b3b82831bcba5c2d36ea661","permalink":"/publication/54/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/54/","section":"publication","summary":"Geographic variation in digital inequality manifests as a result of a range of demographic, attitudinal, behavioural and locational factors. To better understand this multidimensional geography, our paper develops a new geodemographic classification for the spatial extent of Great Britain.

Our analytical approach innovatively provides an integration of machine learning into a small-area estimation technique to obtain Lower Super Output Area / Data Zone estimates of Internet use, alongside a range of online engagement and consumption measures. Following the collation of a range of input measures, we implemented a more standard geodemographic framework that utilises the unsupervised clustering algorithm k-means to produce a map of the multidimensional characteristics of digital inequality for Great Britain; creating the Internet User Classification (IUC). Our outputs provide a new and nuanced understanding of the contemporary salient characteristics of digital inequality in Great Britain, which we evaluate both internally and externally within the context of preparations for the 2021 UK Census of the Population, exploring the geodemographic patterns of Census test response rates and the prevalence to complete the survey online. Our innovative work illustrates the strength of a geodemographic approach in mapping spatial patterns of digital inequality, and through the presented application concerning Census response rates and characteristics we demonstrate how the IUC can be operationalised within such settings for local intervention or benchmarking.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Mapping the Geodemographics of Digital Inequality in Great Britain: An Integration of Machine Learning into Small Area Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunzhe Liu","Alex Singleton","Daniel Arribas Bel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"6403c6d64d083df3442fee05734b38a8","permalink":"/publication/57/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/57/","section":"publication","summary":"Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is a widely recognised planning strategy for encouraging the use of mass and active transport over other less sustainable modes.

However, existing studies aiming to create TOD typologies overwhelmingly concentrate input measures around three dimensions of density, diversity and design; which might be argued as not effectively capturing a fuller picture of context. Moreover, such emphasis on static attributes overlooks the importance of human mobility patterns that are signatures of the dynamics of cities.

Recently, as the urban population expands, the ways in which humans interact with their surroundings has evolved, presenting a dynamic distribution in space and time locally and frequently. Therefore, how to better understand the local urban environment and differentiate varying preferences for urban areas has been a big challenge for policymakers. This study leverages geotagged Flickr photographs to quantify characteristics of varying urban areas and exploit the dynamics of areas where more people assemble. An advanced image recognition model is used to extract features from large numbers of images in Inner London within the period 2013‚Äì2015. After the integration of characteristics, a series of visualisation techniques are utilised to explore the characteristic differences and their dynamics. We find that urban areas with higher population densities cover more iconic landmarks and leisure zones, while others are more related to daily life scenes. The dynamic results demonstrate that season determines human preferences for travel modes and activity modes. Our study expands the previous literature on the integration of image recognition method and urban perception analytics and provides new insights for stakeholders, who can use these findings as vital evidence for decision making.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Quantifying the Characteristics of the Local Urban Environment through Geotagged Flickr Photographs and Image Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574640000,"objectID":"e634949fd195a38810c53941f1973a23","permalink":"/project/urban_analytics/","publishdate":"2019-11-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/urban_analytics/","section":"project","summary":"A repo of code to accompany the book Urban Analytics.","tags":["R","Tutorials"],"title":"Urban Analytics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sam Comber","Dani Arribas-Bel","Alex Singleton","Guanpeng Dong","Les Dolega"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571702400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571702400,"objectID":"e49b913477b5aba52971c37bdeeeed89","permalink":"/publication/51/","publishdate":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/51/","section":"publication","summary":"The perceived quality of urban environments is intrinsically tied to the availability of desirable leisure and retail opportunities. In this article, we explore methodological approaches for deriving indicators that estimate the willingness to pay for retail and leisure services offered by retail centers. Most often, because the quality of urban environments cannot be qualified by a natural unit, the willingness to pay for an urban environment is explored through the lens of the residential housing market. Traditional approaches control for individual characteristics of houses, meaning that the remaining variation in the price can be unpacked and related to the availability of local amenities or, equivalently, the willingness to pay. In this article, we use similar motivations but exchange housing prices for residential properties with property taxes paid by nondomestic properties to glean hierarchies of retail centers. We outline the applied methodological steps that include very recent, nontrivial contributions from the literature to estimate these hierarchies and provide clear instructions for reproducing the methodology. Using the case study of England and Wales, we undertake a series of econometric experiments to rigorously assess retail center willingness to pay (RWTP) as a test of the methods reviewed. We build intuition toward our preferred specification, a Bayesian multilevel model, that accounts for the possibility of a spatial autoregressive process. Overall, the applied methodology describes a blueprint for building hierarchies of retail spaces and addresses the limited availability of spatial data that measure the economic and social value of retail centers.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Building Hierarchies of Retail Centers Using Bayesian Multilevel Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"fe4c5cde3a717f635f0f5c30846e6e62","permalink":"/publication/48/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/48/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years a mix of Open Data and commercial sources have been used to build geodemographic classifications of neighbourhoods.

Using the network analysis process of Routino, postcode accessibility (km) to each of these features were calculated for the whole of Great Britain. An average score for each domain was calculated and subsequently combined to form an overall Index highlighting ‚ÄòAccess to Healthy Assets and Hazards‚Äô.

However, such representations are influenced by the methodological choices made during their construction. Of particular debate are the choice and specification of input variables, with the objective of identifying inputs that add value but also aim for model parsimony. Within this context, our paper introduces a principal component analysis (PCA)-based automated variable selection methodology that has the objective of identifying candidate inputs to a geodemographic classification from a collection of variables. The proposed methodology is exemplified in the context of variables from the UK 2011 Census, and its output compared to the Office for National Statistics 2011 Output Area Classification (2011 OAC). Through the implementation of the proposed methodology, the quality of the cluster assignment was improved relative to 2011 OAC, manifested by a lower total within-cluster sum of square score. Across the UK, more than 70.2% of the Output Areas (OAs) occupied by the newly created classification (i.e. AVS-OAC) outperform the 2011 OAC, with particularly strong performance within Scotland and Wales.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-Based Framework for Automated Variable Selection in Geodemographic Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Les Dolega","Jonathan Reynolds","Alex Singleton","Michalis Pavlis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554422400,"objectID":"b3151153ae307514bdddca062943b091","permalink":"/publication/50/","publishdate":"2019-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/50/","section":"publication","summary":"Early attempts to classify shopping activity often took a relatively simple approach, largely driven by the lack of reliable data beyond fascia name and retail outlet counts by centre. There seems to be a consensus amongst contemporary scholars, commercial research consultancies and retailers that more comprehensive classifications would generate better-informed debate on changes in the urban economic landscape, as well as providing the basis for a more effective comparison of retail centres across time and space, particularly given the availability of new data sources and techniques and in the context of the transformational changes presently affecting the retail sector. This paper seeks to demonstrate the interrelationship between supply and demand for retailing services by integrating newly available data sources within a rigorously specified classification methodology. This in turn provides new insight into the multidimensional and dynamic taxonomy of consumption spaces within Great Britain. First, such a contribution is significant in that it moves debate within the literature past simple linear scaling of retail centre function to a more nuanced understanding of multiple functional forms; and second, in that it provides a nationally comparative and dynamic framework through which the evolution of retail structures can be evaluated. Using non-hierarchical clustering techniques, the results are presented in the form of a two-tier classification with 5 distinctive ‚Äòcoarse‚Äô clusters and 15 more detailed and nested sub-clusters. The paper concludes that more nuanced and dynamic classifications of this kind can help deliver more effective insights into changing role of retailing and consumer services in urban areas across space and through time and will have implications for a variety of stakeholders.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Beyond Retail: New ways of Classifying UK Shopping and Consumption Spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Dani Arribas-Bel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554336000,"objectID":"48bc6c228b56a4495a78f866b28e697f","permalink":"/publication/49/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/49/","section":"publication","summary":"It is widely acknowledged that the emergence of ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù is having a profound and often controversial impact on the production of knowledge.

This paper focuses on urban areas of interest (UAOI), a concept that provides functional definitions of a city‚Äôs spatial structure. Traditional sources of social data can rarely capture these aspects at scale while spatial information on the city alone does not capture how the population values different parts of the city and in different ways. Hence, we leverage volunteered geographic information (VGI) to overcome some of the limits of traditional sources in providing urban structural and functional insights. We use a special type of VGI‚Äîmetadata from geotagged Flickr images‚Äîto identify UAOIs and exploit their temporal and spatial attributes. To do this, we propose a methodological strategy that combines hierarchical density-based spatial clustering for applications with noise and the ‚ÄòŒ±-shape‚Äô algorithm to quantify the dynamics of UAOIs in Inner London for a period 2013‚Äì2015 and develop an innovative visualisation of UAOI profiles from which UAOI dynamics can be explored.

Self-medication is where one ‚Äòself‚Äô diagnoses and prescribes over the counter medicines for treatment. The self-care movement has important policy implications, perceived to relieve the National Health Service (NHS) burden, increasing patient subsistence and freeing resources for more serious ailments. However, there has been little research exploring how self-medication behaviours vary between population groups due to a lack of available data. The aim of our study is to evaluate how high street retailer loyalty card data can help inform our understanding of how individuals self-medicate in England. Transaction level loyalty card data was acquired from a national high street retailer for England for 2012‚Äì2014. We calculated the proportion of loyalty card customers (n ~ 10 million) within Lower Super Output Areas who purchased the following medicines- ‚Äòcoughs and colds‚Äô, ‚ÄòHayfever‚Äô, ‚Äòpain relief‚Äô and ‚Äòsun preps‚Äô. Machine learning was used to explore how 50 sociodemographic and health accessibility features were associated towards explaining purchasing of each product group. Random Forests are used as a baseline and Gradient Boosting as our final model. Our results showed that pain relief was the most common medicine purchased. There was little difference in purchasing behaviours by sex other than for sun preps. The gradient boosting models demonstrated that socioeconomic status of areas, as well as air pollution, were important predictors of each medicine. Our study adds to the self-medication literature through demonstrating the usefulness of loyalty card records for producing insights about how self-medication varies at the national level. Big data offer novel insights that add to and address issues that traditional studies are unable to consider. New forms of data through data linkage may offer opportunities to improve current public health decision making surrounding at risk population groups within self-medication behaviours.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Using Machine Learning to Investigate Self-Medication Purchasing in England via High Street Retailer Loyalty Card Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tamara Thiele","Daniel Pope","Alex Singleton","Debbie Stanistreet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541289600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541289600,"objectID":"837c6541020ce4241c58d7ad32ff85de","permalink":"/publication/47/","publishdate":"2018-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/47/","section":"publication","summary":"Globally, the need for evidence to guide widening participation (WP) practices aimed at reducing inequalities in higher education (HE) participation is recognised more than ever before. In addition, whilst it is also increasingly accepted that approaches drawing on the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative methods (mixed methods) are necessary to develop a more robust evidence base, their use is still not common practice. Given that there is limited guidance on how to combine divergent methods in the field, this may be impeding practitioners and researchers in using mixed methods approaches in WP research.

The variability of retail unit density can be related to both the type and function of retail centers, but also to characteristics such as size and extent of urban areas, population distribution, or property values. The suggested method implements a sparse graph representation of the retail unit locations based on a distance‚Äêconstrained k‚Äênearest neighbor adjacency list that is subsequently decomposed using the Depth First Search algorithm. DBSCAN is iteratively applied to each subgraph to extract the clusters with point density closer to an overall density for each study area. This innovative approach has the advantage of adjusting the radius parameter of DBSCAN at the local scale, thus improving the clustering output. A comparison of the estimated retail clusters against a sample of existing boundaries of retail areas shows that the suggested methodology provides a simple yet accurate and flexible way to automate the process of identifying retail clusters of varying shapes and densities across large areas; and by extension, enables their automated update over time.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Modified DBSCAN Clustering Method to Estimate Retail Center Extent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tamara Thiele","Daniel Pope","Alex Singleton","Darlene Snape","Debbie Stanistreet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1481500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481500800,"objectID":"e96c44ae59c2c3f6fa71af0c52299426","permalink":"/publication/34/","publishdate":"2016-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/34/","section":"publication","summary":"Pervasive socio‚Äêeconomic differences in relation to participation in higher education in the United Kingdom are particularly prominent in the most prestigious institutions.

Underpinned by phenomenology, semi‚Äêstructured interviews were carried out to examine the lived experiences of high‚Äêachieving students from socio‚Äêeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds throughout their educational trajectories from primary school to a Russell Group university. Two main themes emerged from the data- identity and educational engagement. Various sources of disadvantage associated with material hardship, socio‚Äêcultural and interpersonal factors were strongly linked to identity and students‚Äô perceptions of their own social status. In turn, these factors and identity‚Äêrelated constructs associated with peer‚Äêgroup memberships, low expectations and negative group stereotypes affected how individuals engaged with education, contributing, for instance, to their lack of active involvement at school/college and poor attendance. However, identity‚Äêrelated factors were also found to influence individuals‚Äô educational engagement positively, including their motivations for overcoming obstacles, achieving high grades and pursuing HE. The barriers and facilitators discussed by these individuals have important implications for widening access to HE and thus require further consideration.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Experience of Disadvantage: The Influence of Identity on Engagement in Working Class Students‚Äô Educational Trajectories to an Elite University","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexiou Alexandros","Alex Singleton","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"7accb0cfb90222419bc5ea96196e66b4","permalink":"/publication/38/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/38/","section":"publication","summary":"Identifying socio-spatial patterns through geodemographic classification has provenutility over a range of disciplines.

These small area estimates suffer from large margins of error, however, which makes the data difficult to use for many purposes. The value of a large and comprehensive survey like the ACS is that it provides a richly detailed, multivariate, composite picture of small areas. This article argues that one solution to the problem of large margins of error in the ACS is to shift from a variable-based mode of inquiry to one that emphasizes a composite multivariate picture of census tracts. Because the margin of error in a single ACS estimate, like household income, is assumed to be a symmetrically distributed random variable, positive and negative errors are equally likely. Because the variable-specific estimates are largely independent from each other, when looking at a large collection of variables these random errors average to zero. This means that although single variables can be methodologically problematic at the census tract scale, a large collection of such variables provides utility as a contextual descriptor of the place(s) under investigation. This idea is demonstrated by developing a geodemographic typology of all U.S. census tracts. The typology is firmly rooted in the social scientific literature and is organized around a framework of concepts, domains, and measures. The typology is validated using public domain data from the City of Chicago and the U.S. Federal Election Commission. The typology, as well as the data and methods used to create it, is open source and published freely online.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Studying Neighborhoods Using Uncertain Data from the American Community Survey: A Contextual Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1439424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1439424000,"objectID":"bbc2eb749c474e7fa8484bbefac3fd51","permalink":"/publication/31/","publishdate":"2015-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/31/","section":"publication","summary":"Geodemographic classifications are categorical measures representing salient multidimensional population and built environment attributes of small areas.

In it we identify the types of quantitative methods taught in the geography curricula for UK schools and universities, and discuss attitudes towards those methods amongst students and teachers. We argue that geography has benefitted from its position at the intersection of the sciences, social sciences and humanities, retaining a quantitative component. Consequently, levels of basic numeracy and data handling have remained relatively high, leaving the discipline well placed to respond to the call for greater quantitative training within the social sciences in the UK. However, we also suspect that the typical levels of quantitative training in university human geography courses are not sufficiently high to compete on the international stage. As the title suggests, our report is focused on geography. However we raise issues germane to other disciplines including what actually we mean by quantitative methods, what should be taught in a twenty-first century curriculum, how to meaningfully embed those methods in the substantive themes and teaching of a discipline, and whether more should be expected as a minimum standard of quantitative competence than the existing Quality Assurance Agency benchmarks require.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Geographers Count: A Report on Quantitative Methods in Geography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nick Bearman","Alex Singleton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"4c25b2c89310aa30cf192cbda8192b6f","permalink":"/publication/29/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/29/","section":"publication","summary":"Active travel for the home to school commute is an ideal opportunity to improve pupils physical activity levels.

This paper presents analysis of 4.7 million crowdsourced Internet speed test results that were compiled between 2010 and 2013 alongside various indicators of socio-spatial structure to map disparities in English broadband speed between and within urban areas. Although average speeds have improved over time, inequity is shown to emerge between different societal groups and locations. Short-term dynamics also reveal that in areas of different density, speeds can fall dramatically during peak hours, thus influencing the availability of services. The apparent disparities in access and performance represent a major issue as Internet use becomes increasingly ubiquitous in our everyday lives, with inequalities evoking social and economic disadvantage at local and national scales.

However, as part of this open selection, the demand from parents opting to send their children to the best performing schools far outstrips the supply of available places at them, and consequently many schools ration places using entry criteria that favour those pupils domiciled close to the school. Through this geographic selection process, choice is spatially sorted and access to the best schools is often crucially dependent upon where parents live. After illustrating this problem, this paper develops an automated modelling technique that can be used to define and map school catchment areas based on the home locations of pupils attending every publically funded school in England. It then develops this framework to create a web based decision support tool to aid parents seeking secondary school places.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Estimating Secondary School Catchment Areas and the Spatial Equity of Access","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Daniel Lewis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1320537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1320537600,"objectID":"1a4aa3e4c45f2f0bdfc2d32bd6626401","permalink":"/publication/15/","publishdate":"2011-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/15/","section":"publication","summary":"Between 2005 and 2007 there were 9071 traffic accidents involving bicycles within London and this paper demonstrates the utility of Geographic Information Systems as a tool for analysing and visualising these occurrences.

These issues have received attention in the literature, yet rather little research has been carried out on the uncertainty subsequently created through the analysis of such measurements. We argue that, while general-purpose ethnicity classifications offer a method of standardising results, such groupings are inherently unstable, both in their upward aggregation and in their downward granulation. As such, the results of ethnicity analysis may possess no validity independent of the ethnicity classes upon which it is based. While this conclusion is intuitive, it nevertheless seems to pass unnoticed in the interpretation of research conducted in public policy applications such as education, health and residential segregation. In this paper we use examples based on the standard Census classification of ethnicity, alongside new rich ethnicity datasets from the education domain, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of results to the particular aggregation that is chosen. We use a case study to empirically illustrate the far-reaching consequences of this commonly overlooked source of uncertainty.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Uncertainty in the Analysis of Ethnicity Classifications: Issues of Extent and Aggregation of Ethnic Groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Longley","Alex Singleton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1249430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1249430400,"objectID":"a681461fae55d5dacc4c270d16511ffe","permalink":"/publication/8/","publishdate":"2009-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8/","section":"publication","summary":"Although viewed by business and commerce as successful solutions, geodemographic profiling of neighbourhoods has attracted wide-ranging criticism in the academic literature.

In response to the critique of geodemographics as a ‚Äòblack box‚Äô technology, we describe how the classification was opened up to public scrutiny and how we conducted a major consultation exercise into the reliability of its results. We assess the message of the 50,000+ searches and 3952 responses collected during the consultation exercise, in terms of possible systematic errors in the shape and detail of the classification. Unusually for Internet-based surveys, we also investigate the likely reliability of the response information received and identify ways in which the outcome of consultation might be used to improve the classification. We believe that this is the first-ever large-scale consultation survey of the validity and remit of a geodemographic classification and that it may have wider implications for the creation of geodemographic classifications.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Classification through Consultation: Public Views of the Geography of the e-Society","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1249430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1249430400,"objectID":"8b4dbaef88dd2e19cc11689be16ba2d5","permalink":"/publication/4/","publishdate":"2009-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/4/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper explores the use of geodemographic classifications to investigate the social, economic and spatial dimensions of participation in Higher Education (HE).
